# 4x4x4 Tic-Tac-Toe player in Prolog

This is a 4x4x4 3D Tic-Tac-Toe player written in Prolog using minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.

It has a socket connection, so you can write your own player using other programming language and let them play against each other. You can even connect using PuTTY (Raw mode) and try to win from the computer (very difficult task, but not impossible!).

This project was developed for for the discipline of Artificial Intelligence of UFMG, Brazil.

*Flaws:* It is a weak player, in the sense it doesn't contain any offensive heuristic to win; feel free to add your own!

Enjoy!
